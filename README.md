# An-Automated-Green-House-Monitoring-and-Controlling-System

Green house environment monitoring technology has continuously improved, and good greenhouse environment can continuously improve crop quality, short the growth cycle and increase production.

This project deals with a simple, easy to install, microcontroller-based circuit to monitor and record the value of temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light of the green house that are continuously monitored and controlled in order to achieve maximum plant growth and yield.

The controller communicates with the various sensor module in real-time in order to control the light, humidity, temperature and soil moisture level by actuating a fan, dryer, water pump, and light respectively according to the necessary condition of the crops. 

As the cost for this system is quite less it is primarily focused for the farmers of the Nepal as they cannot afford high end devices. LCD screen and website has been used so that user can easily monitor from anywhere.

This project uses the two arduino. One for sending the data to the cloud and another for recieving the data and according to the data it activates a actuator connected to it
